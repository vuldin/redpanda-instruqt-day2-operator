  Redpanda is a Kafka-compatible streaming data platform that is less complex and less costly than any other commercial mission-critical event streaming platform. It's fast, it's easy, and it keeps your data safe.

  In this tutorial, you learn how to manage Redpanda when deployed in Kubernetes with the Redpanda Operator.
